# Getting started with Git

## Tools

You'll need to install Git, and I recommend also installing your choice of GUI which will save you from needing to write code. Personally I (_author_) recommend Visual Studio Code (_VSCode_), but there are lots of options. 

Some of these are full Integrated Development Environments (_IDE_), which do ALL your programming needs, others just do the Git stuff.

## Steps
0. Install Git
0. Set up your profile - **this will be public**
    ```powershell
    $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    ```
0. Install VS Code (_or other IDE / Git GUI_)
0. Create a folder on your computer, relatively high in your files: 
    *i.e. a new folder within `C:` or `C:\Users\YOUR_NAME_HERE\Documents`*

    !!! tip "Long filepaths"
    
        Most computers have a maximum filename length and trying to clone this repo into a long filepath like `C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Documents\Warhammer\FunProjects\PublicStuff\HeresySilhouettes\...` will throw a wobbly once it hits 256 characters
0. Open the project in GitHub *(where you're reading this)*, select `Code` and then the copy icon near "Clone using this web URL"
0. Open VS Code *(or equivalent)* and using the *Source Control* tab
0. Select "Clone Repository" and then paste the URL you copied earlier
0. Select the folder you made earlier as your "target directory"
0. Create a new branch
0. Make your changes
0. Save your changes
0. Stage & Commit your changes - this is where you put them on the Git record
0. Push your branch when you're done or the work has reached a stable milestone - this is what makes it accessible to others
0. Once it's ready for review, create a Pull Request on GitHub, outlining your changes!!
0. Someone will review & approve your changes, or give you suggestions to go back and fix
0. Done! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

!!! warning "Commit a file"
    Git doesn't upload empty folders, you have to create a file in the folder for it to be detected. 
    
    If someone hasn't created a file, there *should* be a placeholder in there.
