This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. This was used to set up the initial folders for image files & seed them with a file

```{r}
## required packages
library(stringr)
```

```{r}
## Declear highlevel structure
Factions <- c("Daemons", "Legions", "Mechanicum", "Militia", "Solar")
ForceTypes <- c("Primary", "Sub_Faction_Name")
ForceOrg <- c("1_HQ", "2_Elites", "3_Troops", "4_Fast_Attack", "5_Heavy_Support", "6_Lords_of_War", "7_Dedicated_Transport", "8_Body_Guard")

folderCount <- length(Factions) * length(ForceTypes) * length(ForceOrg)

folders <- seq(1:folderCount)
```

```{r}
index = 1
## Create folder paths for placeholder files
for (faction in Factions) {
  for (forceType in ForceTypes) {
      for (slot in ForceOrg) {
        folders[index] = (stringr::str_c(faction,"/", forceType, "/", slot))
        index = index + 1
    }
  }
}
## reset counters 
index = 1

```


``` {r}
setwd(dirname(getwd()))

## make some placeholder dirs
fileContents <- "PLACEHOLDER"
fileName <- "Placeholder.txt"

for (counter in seq(1:length(folders))){
  dirPath <- stringr::str_c("Factions/", folders[counter])
  dir.create(file.path(getwd(), dirPath), recursive = TRUE)
  write.table(
    fileContents
    , file = file.path(getwd(), dirPath, fileName)
    , sep = "\t"
    , row.names = FALSE
  ) ## end file write
} 

```
